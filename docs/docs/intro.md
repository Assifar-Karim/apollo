Apollo is a lightweight modern kubernetes native map reduce framework based on the original Google MapReduce paper.\
Apollo provides a distributed computation framework grafted on top of the kubernetes orchestrator while requiring minimal configuration and staying lightweight. It mainly relies on S3 based object storages as input sources instead of bulky distributed filesystems such as HDFS or GFS.
